Logo of the Chaotikum e.V.
==========================

Definition and styles for the Chaotikum logo.

This project could also be described as: How do I overengineer something as
simple as a picture?  Here is one idea: Create the picture from an XML file by
transforming it to SVG via XSLT.  Or, to phrase it differently: Create XML by
converting XML using XML.  Yeah, right.

Create a svg from the XML definition by running (e.g.)

```
xsltproc --output chip-prompt-orig.svg svg-creator.xslt chip-prompt-orig.xml
```
